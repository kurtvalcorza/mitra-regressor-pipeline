# DIMER finetuner — Mitra tabular regression (GPU image, with CPU fallback).
# CUDA 12.8 / torch 2.8 base: ships sm_120 (Blackwell, e.g. RTX 5070 Ti) kernels plus
# sm_70–sm_100, and satisfies AutoGluon 1.5.0's torch>=2.6,<2.10 requirement — so pip does
# NOT silently swap the base image's torch at install time. Do NOT downgrade to
# cuda12.4/torch2.5: that build lacks sm_120 and dies with "no kernel image is available" on
# RTX 50-series / B200 GPUs, and AutoGluon would upgrade torch anyway. train.py detects the
# GPU at runtime, so this image also runs on a CPU-only node (zero-shot); for a lean CPU-only
# image instead, use Dockerfile.cpu.
