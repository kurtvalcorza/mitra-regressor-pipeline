"""DIMER portal entrypoint for the Mitra tabular-regression validator.

The DIMER Pipeline Builder builds this repository from its root and launches the
validation container by the portal naming convention (``validate.py``). The
tested implementation lives in ``validator.py``; this thin shim only delegates to
it so that ``validator.py``, its unit tests, and the cross-repo shared block stay
byte-identical. Keep this file free of logic.
