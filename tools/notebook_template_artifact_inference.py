Basic pandas and Colab or Jupyter familiarity are enough; no prior experience with AutoGluon is assumed — each term is explained where it first matters and again in the **Glossary**. CPU is enough.\n\n**Input → Model → Output.**\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| Input | an externally produced bundle `mitra_regressor_predictor.zip` (via `ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH` or the Colab upload dialog) with its trusted SHA-256 in `EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256`, and one unlabelled CSV with the bundle's feature columns (via `NEW_DATA_PATH` or the dialog) |\n| Model | the AutoGluon `TabularPredictor` reconstructed from the bundle alone (the pinned `autogluon/mitra-regressor` base checkpoint is verified in Section 3 only so the bundle's recorded digests can be checked) |\n| Output | a continuous point estimate in the target's units, with no uncertainty interval for every input row; an input manifest with one recorded refusal; an evaluation report whose verdict is `not-measurable` (no labels); `result.json` with the bundle identity and provenance |\n\n**How to use this notebook.** Set `ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH`, `EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256` and `NEW_DATA_PATH` in Sections 4 and 6 (on Colab, an empty path opens the upload dialog instead), then **Runtime → Run all**. With both paths set, Run all completes in one pass: Section 1 installs nothing into the notebook's own Python, so no restart is needed. Sections 1–3 are **infrastructure** — the isolated environment, the carried module and the verified base snapshot — and their cells are collapsed; you may run them without studying them. The learning path starts in Section 4. Before each principal result the notebook asks you to **Predict**; after it comes a collapsible **Check your reasoning**. No hosted run of this companion is recorded yet (it is queued), so the answers describe what the checks do, not numbers to match. **Troubleshooting**, a **Glossary** and a **Conclusion** template are at the end.\n\n**Roadmap:** 1–3 infrastructure → 4 the bundle: whole-archive digest, safe extraction, manifest and provenance *(core concept: what is verified before any deserialisation, and what is not)* → 5 runtime compatibility and reconstruction from the bundle alone *(engineering)* → 6 new rows, the input manifest and a deliberate refusal *(core concept: the fitted schema is the contract)* → 7 predict, report `not-measurable`, export *(evaluation practice: what cannot be measured without labels)* → conclude."

The default path runs on CPU and uses CUDA automatically when available.",
