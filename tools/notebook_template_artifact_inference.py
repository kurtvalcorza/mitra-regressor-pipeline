"""Companion template for tools/build_notebook.py — ARTIFACT-INFERENCE (NOTEBOOK_SPEC 1.1 §3.6, §18).

Generate with ``python tools/build_notebook.py --template tools/notebook_template_artifact_inference.py``. The
notebook carries the same package module and the same pinned snapshot as the E2E notebook; it consumes an
AutoGluon predictor bundle (`mitra_regressor_predictor.zip`) produced by a *separate* execution (upload, or an
explicit path for non-interactive executors) and never creates one.

        "A successful run proves that the supplied archive passed the package's path, symlink, size and manifest/digest "
        "checks, that its recorded model and runtime contract matched this notebook and the carried pinned base-model "
        "identity, that AutoGluon reconstructed the predictor from the bundle alone, that the new CSV satisfied the "
        "required feature schema, and that machine-readable regression predictions were produced — without the "
        "repository being reachable. It does **not** prove that the archive came from a trustworthy sender, that Python "
        "deserialisation is safe for untrusted artifacts, or that the predictor is accurate, calibrated, fair, robust, or "
        "suitable for a production decision; the evaluation report says `not-measurable` because no labels exist here. "
        "Never bypass a failed digest, path, manifest, base-model or schema check; obtain a correct trusted bundle.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's package, carried in this notebook, can "
        "acquire and digest-verify the pinned checkpoint, validate and reconstruct an external predictor bundle, validate "
        "the supplied inference table, execute the public prediction path and emit the shown machine-readable outputs in "
        "the tested runtime. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, deployment calibration, safety for "
        "high-consequence decisions, or production fitness on an unseen domain.\n\n"
