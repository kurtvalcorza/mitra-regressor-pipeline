"""Companion template for tools/build_notebook.py — ARTIFACT-INFERENCE (NOTEBOOK_SPEC 2.2 §4, §19).

Generate with ``python tools/build_notebook.py --template tools/notebook_template_artifact_inference.py``. The
notebook carries the same package module and the same pinned snapshot as the E2E notebook; it consumes an
AutoGluon predictor bundle (`mitra_regressor_predictor.zip`) produced by a *separate* execution and never creates one.
The default path downloads the trusted sample bundle pinned in ``SAMPLE_ARTIFACT`` (release asset
``sample-bundle-v1`` of this repository, written by the E2E notebook in a recorded Colab T4 run) and verifies its
whole-archive SHA-256 before extraction (NOTEBOOK_SPEC SART6-SART8); its sample input is the producer's independent
test partition re-derived from scikit-learn's bundled table. ``ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH`` / ``NEW_DATA_PATH`` switch to
your own bundle and rows (a path, or ``upload`` for the Colab dialog).

Basic pandas and Colab or Jupyter familiarity are enough; no prior experience with AutoGluon is assumed — each term is explained where it first matters and again in the **Glossary**. CPU is enough.\n\n**Input → Model → Output.**\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| Input | by default, the trusted sample bundle `mitra_regressor_predictor.zip` (release `sample-bundle-v1`, SHA-256 pinned) and 89 unlabelled sample rows; optionally your own bundle (`ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH` + `EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256`) and your own unlabelled CSV (`NEW_DATA_PATH`) |\n| Model | the AutoGluon `TabularPredictor` reconstructed from the bundle alone (the pinned `autogluon/mitra-regressor` base checkpoint is verified in Section 3 only so the bundle's recorded digests can be checked) |\n| Output | a continuous point estimate in the target's units, with no uncertainty interval for every input row; an input manifest with one recorded refusal; an evaluation report whose verdict is `not-measurable` (no labels); `result.json` with the bundle identity and provenance |\n\n**How to use this notebook.** Choose a runtime and **Runtime → Run all**. With no field edited, Run all completes in one pass, scoring the sample rows with the pinned sample bundle: Section 1 installs nothing into the notebook's own Python, so no restart is needed. Sections 1–3 are **infrastructure** — the isolated environment, the carried module and the verified base snapshot — and their cells are collapsed; you may run them without studying them. The learning path starts in Section 4. Before each principal result the notebook asks you to **Predict**; after it comes a collapsible **Check your reasoning**. The answers describe what the checks do, not numbers to match; recorded runs of each notebook revision are listed in the repository's `docs/release-verification.md`. Section 8 is a short activity: shift one feature and explain how the predictions move. **Troubleshooting**, a **Glossary** and a **Conclusion** template are at the end.\n\n**Roadmap:** 1–3 infrastructure → 4 the bundle: whole-archive digest, safe extraction, manifest and provenance *(core concept: what is verified before any deserialisation, and what is not)* → 5 runtime compatibility and reconstruction from the bundle alone *(engineering)* → 6 new rows, the input manifest and a deliberate refusal *(core concept: the fitted schema is the contract)* → 7 predict, report `not-measurable`, export *(evaluation practice: what cannot be measured without labels)* → 8 activity: shift one feature *(interpretation)* → conclude."

        "- **Runtime:** a fresh supported **Linux x86_64** runtime (Google Colab, Kaggle or a Linux Jupyter server). Section 1 builds its own Python 3.12.12 environment from a hash-locked list of manylinux wheels (AutoGluon 1.5.0 and its torch), so nothing is installed into the kernel; a Windows or macOS kernel is not supported. The AutoGluon and Python major/minor versions of that environment must match the ones recorded in the bundle (the E2E tutorial of this revision exports under the same environment). The default path runs on CPU and uses CUDA automatically when available.",
        "- **Artifact:** by default the trusted sample bundle, downloaded from this repository's release `sample-bundle-v1` (about 280 MB, no sign-in) and checked against its pinned SHA-256 before extraction; it was produced by the E2E tutorial in a recorded run, outside this execution, under Python 3.12 and AutoGluon 1.5.0 (an AutoGluon bundle loads only under the same AutoGluon version and Python major/minor, so a new isolated-environment Python needs a new bundle and a new tag). Your own bundle (the E2E tutorial writes `outputs/mitra_regressor_predictor.zip` and prints its SHA-256) is optional: copy it into the runtime — a Kaggle dataset, Google Drive or `gsutil` copy — and set `ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH` to it with its trusted SHA-256 in `EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256`. `ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH = 'upload'` opens the Colab dialog, which is impractical for a bundle this size. Nothing in this notebook manufactures a bundle.",
        "- **Data:** by default 89 sample rows: the producer's independent test partition of scikit-learn's bundled diabetes table (re-derived from the installed package with the bundle's recorded seed, target removed), rows the bundle's support set never contained. Optionally one separate, unlabelled UTF-8 CSV with the bundle's feature columns via `NEW_DATA_PATH` (`upload` opens the Colab dialog). The sample rows fit only the sample bundle; with your own bundle, give your own rows. Do not upload confidential or restricted data to a hosted notebook environment unless you are authorized to do so. Uploaded inputs remain in the notebook runtime; this pipeline does not send them to a third-party inference API.",

        '- **Section 3 reports a size or SHA-256 mismatch, or cannot reach the Hub** — the message names the file (`model.safetensors`, 302,683,140 bytes, or `config.json`). Delete the folder Section 3 prints as `weights_dir` and run Section 3 again.\n'
        '- **"A trusted whole-archive SHA-256 is required"** — paste the digest the E2E tutorial printed into `EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256`; `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_ARTIFACT = True` is only for an already-trusted local bundle and prints a warning.\n'
        "- **The sample download fails or times out** — run Section 4 again (a complete download is reused); `github.com` release downloads must be reachable. The pinned SHA-256 is checked before extraction, so a partial or altered file is never used.\n"

        '- **"Predictor ZIP checksum mismatch" / an unsafe-path, size or digest failure / "Bundle was not produced on the pinned base checkpoint"** — the archive is not the one you trust, is altered, or was built on another base model: reject it and obtain the bundle again. Never bypass a failed check.\n'
        '- **"Artifact requires AutoGluon …" / "exported under Python …"** — the bundle is Python-serialised: use the runtime the producer used (the isolated environment pins AutoGluon 1.5.0 on CPython 3.12.12, the same as the E2E tutorial\'s).\n'
        "- **BYOD: \"… = 'upload' needs the Colab upload dialog\" / \"Upload exactly one …\"** — set `ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH` and `NEW_DATA_PATH` to files in the runtime (Kaggle dataset, Drive, Jupyter); `upload` works only on Colab, and a cancelled dialog stops with that message. A bundle of about 280 MB is better copied than uploaded.\n"
        '- **A `ValueError` from `validate_inputs`, `read_csv_bytes` or the numeric check** — it names the rule: a duplicate header, a missing required feature, a pre-existing `prediction` column, or a value that cannot be read as a number in a numeric feature.
