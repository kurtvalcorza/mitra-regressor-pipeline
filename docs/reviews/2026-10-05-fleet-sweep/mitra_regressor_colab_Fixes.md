# mitra_regressor_colab — fleet-sweep fixes (2026-10-05)

Targeted fix of the 2026-10-05 fleet sweep findings. There is no full Notebook Review Framework v1 report for this
notebook; each flag was first confirmed in the cell source on `main` (`dc2d022`). All changes are made in the
generator (`tools/build_notebook.py`, `tools/notebook_template*.py`) and the notebook is regenerated. STATUS and the
release labels are unchanged. **Readiness: Verification pending** (hosted Run all not yet done).

## Findings and fixes

| ID | Status | Change | Cells / files touched | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SWP-R | Fixed — hosted confirmation pending | Confirmed: Section 1 ran `pip install` into the kernel and raised "Restart the runtime" on stale modules. Generator upgraded to `build_notebook.py/2.2` (the fleet isolated runtime): one kernel cell downloads the pinned `uv` 0.12.15 wheel (size + SHA-256), builds a managed CPython 3.12.12 environment from the new hash lock `tutorials/requirements-colab-isolated.lock.txt` (74 entries, compiled from the pyproject pins; the pre-existing pip-compile reference locks beside it are unchanged) (`--require-hashes --only-binary :all:`), and routes every later cell to one persistent worker. The environment folder is keyed on the lock digest and reused by a re-run or a second Run all; re-running Section 1 keeps the live worker and its variables; the worker gets `MPLBACKEND=Agg` and no `PYTHONPATH`/`PYTHONHOME`/`PYTHONSTARTUP`. | Section 1 (kernel cell + "Record the runtime"); `tools/build_notebook.py`; `tutorials/requirements-colab-isolated.lock.txt`; `tools/validate_release_assets.py` (install markers, bootstrap check, kernel cell excluded from the library-use scan); `docs/release-verification.md` (the line describing that check); `tools/notebook_template_artifact_inference.py` inherits the isolated-runtime keys, so both notebooks share one lock | `test_swp_r_no_pip_install_or_restart_in_any_cell`, `test_swp_r_lock_is_carried_hash_locked_and_matches_pins`, `test_swp_r_environment_keyed_on_lock_and_child_env_cleaned`, `test_swp_r_section1_reuses_environment_and_worker_when_rerun` (executes the notebook's own kernel cell with a stand-in IPython shell; the worker runs on the test interpreter) |
| SWP-G | Fixed | Confirmed: 1 of 9 guided markers on `main`. Guided opening added (audience, Input → Model → Output, How to use this notebook with the one-pass Run all statement, roadmap with concept tags); a **Predict** prompt before Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 and five collapsible **Check your reasoning** answers. The record keeps the stages and sizes but no metric values, so the answers quote the recorded 2026-09-14 Kaggle T4 run (159.4 s, 9/9 cells; `model.safetensors` 302,683,140 bytes; the stages and outputs it lists) and give directions and magnitudes for the metrics without inventing numbers. Troubleshooting (isolated runtime, snapshot, memory, gate/source agreement, BYOD, validation errors, reload), Change one thing, Glossary and Conclusion (your notes) sections; Sections 1–3 labelled Infrastructure and collapsed. | `tools/notebook_template.py` (`guided.opening`, prerequisites, `run_all`, Sections 4–9 markdown, closing) | `test_swp_g_guided_layer_present`, `test_swp_g_infrastructure_cells_labelled_and_collapsed`, `test_swp_g_no_leftover_placeholders`, `test_swp_g_checkpoint_answers_quote_only_recorded_facts` |
| SWP-A | Not applicable | The sweep found no quality assert; the fine-tuning gate already selects on the holdout without asserting, and Section 9's reload checks are contracts. | — | — |
| SWP-F | Not applicable | `pipe` is conditioned (`fine_tune=False`), never gradient-updated; the optional fine-tune builds a separate `candidate` pipeline. | — | — |
| SWP-B | Fixed | Confirmed in the Section 4 cell: both upload sources worked only through `google.colab.files.upload()`. Section 4 gains a `BYOD_PATH` form field read by `byod_payloads` — one labelled CSV, or a directory holding `train.csv`, `val.csv` and `test.csv` for the pre-split source (Kaggle/Jupyter); the Colab upload is the guarded fallback, and a cancelled, partial or wrong upload, a runtime without the dialog, a missing path, a missing file and a non-CSV file each get a message naming the file and the rule. | Section 4 code; `byod` header text | `test_swp_b_byod_path_reads_a_csv_or_a_presplit_directory_and_refusals_name_the_file`, `test_swp_b_cancelled_or_partial_uploads_are_named_and_a_good_upload_works`, `test_swp_b_byod_gate_is_off_by_default_and_has_a_path_field` |

## User-visible changes

- Section 1 of both notebooks is one collapsed infrastructure cell that builds (or reuses) `dimer_isolated_env_<lock digest>/` from the new hash-locked `tutorials/requirements-colab-isolated.lock.txt` (74 entries: AutoGluon 1.5.0 with its torch, LightGBM, huggingface-hub) and routes later cells to it; nothing is installed into the kernel and Run all needs no restart. Linux x86_64 runtimes only.
- Guided-layer markdown throughout both notebooks; Sections 1–3 collapsed; Troubleshooting, Change one thing, Glossary and Conclusion sections at the end.
- `mitra_regressor_colab`: Section 4 gains `BYOD_PATH` (a CSV, or a pre-split directory); BYOD refusals name the file and the rule. `mitra_regressor_predictor_inference_colab`: Section 6 names the missing dialog instead of a `NameError`.
- The workshop and capstone notebooks and their generators are untouched.
- `docs/release-verification.md`: the two lines describing the in-kernel install and restart now describe the isolated bootstrap. No status text changed.

## Verification (offline; not clean-runtime evidence)

- No model stage ran here (AutoGluon and torch are never installed in CI or here; the Hub is unreachable); no pretrained-inference evidence is claimed. Checkpoint answers quote only the structural facts of the 2026-09-14 record and give no metric number.
- Stand-ins: the Section 1 kernel cell is executed with a stand-in environment and IPython shell; the Section 4 `byod_payloads` helper with temporary files and a fake `google.colab.files.upload`.
- `python tools/build_notebook.py --check` (both templates): OK. `python tools/validate_release_assets.py`: PASS. Every CI runner-Python script (`check_shared`, `check_contract`, `validate_colab_tutorial`, `test_tutorial_api`, `test_colab_csv_headers`, `test_sample_registry`): OK. `ruff check mitra_pipeline tests tools`: clean. `pytest` (CI deps: pandas, numpy): 75 passed before → 91 passed after.
- `uv pip install --dry-run --require-hashes --only-binary :all: -r tutorials/requirements-colab-isolated.lock.txt` into a `uv venv --managed-python --python 3.12.12`: resolves, would install 74 packages (the two repositories' locks are identical apart from the header).

## Remaining gates

- A hosted **Run all in one pass** on a fresh runtime (expected: no restart prompt; Section 1 builds the environment; a second Run all reports `'reused': True`).
- The REL12 BYOD run with the BYOD gates and path fields set.
- Hosted confirmation that AutoGluon's Mitra model resolves the offline Hugging Face snapshot from inside the isolated environment as it did from the in-kernel install (same pins, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` set by Section 3).
- The companion notebook still has no hosted run (registry: queued); its Run all needs `ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH`, `EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256` and `NEW_DATA_PATH` set.
- A full Notebook Review Framework v1 review has not been done.
